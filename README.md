# Monte Carlo Particle Simulation

This repository contains a simple and extensible Monte Carlo simulation of particle dynamics. The aim is to model the random motion and energy loss of particles in a medium, a technique commonly used in statistical physics, radiation detection, and high-energy particle transport.

## Features

- Simulates particle motion using probabilistic energy loss models
- Computes penetration range of particles
- Visualizes distribution of ranges via histogram
- Easily extendable for research in radiation detection, ion transport, and solid-state physics

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required Python libraries:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:traut-code/Monte-Carlo-Particle-Simulation.git
cd Monte-Carlo-Particle-Simulation
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Optional if you create one
